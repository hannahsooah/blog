# blog

minimalist Jekyll website currently published through github pages.

nothing much to it, i just got sick of wordpress UI and ads so i decided to try DIYing it.

I might private this repo later and host on a different domain because... I'm not sure if I want to link my personal blog to a public dev account lol

## cool things to add later (maybe sooner):

* change font to be easier on the eyes and have more contrast (i don't like the
current font)
* personalize website with more color, a custom domain, a
[homepage](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme), etc.
* [formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) contact form integration for subscribers
* [google analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) support.
* add [encrypted posts](https://github.com/lilykonings/jekyll-password-protect)
for backwards compatibility
* look up a way to add short description under post title for preview
