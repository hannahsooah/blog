minimalist Jekyll website currently published through github pages.
nothing much to it, i just got sick of wordpress UI and ads so i decided to 
try DIYing it.

## cool things to add later (maybe sooner):

* change font to be easier on the eyes and have more contrast (i don't like the
current font)
* personalize website more with color, 
[homepage](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme), etc.
* [formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) contact form integration for subscribers
* [google analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) support.
